It is the first NASA high priority science mission launched by SpaceX. It was the first time SpaceX launched a scientific satellite not primarily intended for Earth observations. The second stage placed it into a high-Earth elliptical orbit, after which the satellite's own booster will perform complex maneuvers including a lunar flyby, and over the course of two months, reach a stable, 2:1 resonant orbit with the Moon. In January 2018, SpaceX received NASA's Launch Services Program Category 2 certification of its Falcon 9 'Full Thrust', certification which is required for launching medium risk missions like TESS. It was the last launch of a new Block 4 booster, and marked the 24th successful recovery of the booster. An experimental water landing was performed in order to attempt fairing recovery.","crew":[],"ships":["5ea6ed2e080df4000697c90a","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90b","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90d","5ea6ed30080df4000697c913"],"capsules":[],"payloads":["5eb0e4c7b6c3bb0006eeb222"],"launchpad":"5e9e4501f509094ba4566f84","auto_update":true,"launch_library_id":null,"failures":[],"flight_number":60,"name":"TESS","date_utc":"2018-04-18T22:51:00.000Z","date_unix":1524091860,"date_local":"2018-04-18T18:51:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a5f35918863d3b2655","flight":1,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":false,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"id":"5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365"}
